        <p>  The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for
           an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
           <br>

          The position Property
          The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for
           an element.
           <br>

          There are five different position values: <br>

          static
          relative
          fixed
          absolute
          sticky <br>
      <p>    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right
          properties. However, these properties will not work unless the
          position property is set first. They also work differently depending
          on the position value. </p>

      <p>    position: static;
          HTML elements are positioned static by default.

          Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

          An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
          </p>


      <p>    position: relative;
          An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

          Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
          </p>

      <p>    position: fixed;
          An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

          A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

          Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:
          </p>


          <p> position: absolute;
          An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

          However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
          </p>


          <p>position: sticky;
          An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

          A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
          </p>

          <p> Overlapping Elements <br>

          When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

          The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
